    quote: 'We worked with the team at Health Velocity at our prior company, Change Healthcare, and now at IVX Health. There’s just no investor better networked in healthcare.  They have made literally hundreds of valuable introductions over the years that have directly driven revenue to our businesses and expanded our networks.'

    company: 'Well Health',
    quote: 'We weren’t even raising money, and they introduced us to clients and board members long before we were even formal partners… we were so impressed, we invited them to invest when we didn’t need the money and at a lower valuation than we could have gotten elsewhere.  And it has been more than worth it.  Since investing, they have introduced us to a number of additional customers, helped pushed some prospects they know over the finish line, and introduced us to more team members and a key advisor who has driven the most important partnership in our company’s history.'

    company: 'Zipari',
    quote: 'We had been friendly with the Health Velocity team for years, and they helped with customer introductions before they even invested.  We didn’t need outside capital but invited them to invest in our company and join our board because we wanted them on our team.  Since investing, they’ve been invaluable not only with additional customer introductions that have driven revenue and fueled our pipeline but also introductions to team members we have hired, sales and marketing strategy, capital raise strategy, and Advisory Board development.'

    company: 'Contessa',
    quote: 'We actually took capital from Health Velocity Capital at a lower valuation than what other investors had offered… and it was worth it. Almost immediately after investing, the Health Velocity Capital team facilitated commercial relationships with one of largest payers and one of largest health systems in the US.'

    company: 'Ginger',
    quote: 'We had lots of options for our syndicate, and we proactively chose Health Velocity and expanded our financing for them.  They are so highly regarded in the community and so well-networked and have really leaned in since their investment.  That’s what really distinguishes them – the elbow grease.  They have introduced us to potential customers, distributions partners, and Board members and also initiated a commercial relationship with one of the largest insurers in the country.'

    quote: 'There’s nothing the Health Velocity Capital team wouldn’t do for their companies.  When the Cavaliers beat the Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals, Marty lost a bet to me and had to put a poster of ME in his (and his wife’s) bedroom for a full year!  They not only introduced us to our VP Sales before they even invested, have introduced us to an industry leading board member and several clients, and are patient, supportive, long-term partners, but they are also great friends.'
