    quote: 'Between Teladoc, Livongo, MDLive, and many others, I’m not aware of any other investor with more experience in telehealth than the Health Velocity team. We proactively chose them as our partner, and since investing, they have been immensely helpful. They have been strategic thought partners and have used their network and reputation to introduce us to potential customers, distribution partners, and Board members. They also initiated a commercial relationship with one of the largest insurers in the country. In sum, they are world class health tech investors.'

    quote: 'We’ve worked with the team at HVC on multiple occasions, most notably at our prior company, Change Healthcare, and now at IVX Health. One of the things that differentiates them from others, beyond the simple fact that they have an attractive base of strategic LPs, is their intimate knowledge of the healthcare industry as a whole, and their willingness to roll up their sleeves and engage directly with their network on behalf of their portfolio companies.  Those introductions and facilitated conversations, on multiple occasions, have directly resulted in new business wins, product roadmap enhancements, and adjustments to our overall strategic plan.'

    company: 'Well Health',
    quote: 'We weren’t even raising money, and they introduced us to clients and board members long before we were even formal partners… we were so impressed, we invited them to invest when we didn’t need the money and at a lower valuation than we could have gotten elsewhere.  And it has been more than worth it.  Since investing, they have introduced us to a number of additional customers, helped push some prospects they know over the finish line, introduced us to talented executives who became team members, and recruited a key advisor who has driven the most important partnership in our company’s history.'

    company: 'Zipari',
    quote: 'We had been friendly with the Health Velocity team for years, and they helped with customer introductions before they even invested.  We didn’t need outside capital but invited them to invest in our company and join our board because we wanted them on our team.  Since investing, they’ve been invaluable not only with additional customer introductions that have driven revenue and fueled our pipeline but also introductions to team members we have hired, sales and marketing strategy, capital raise strategy, and Advisory Board development.'

    company: 'Contessa',
    quote: 'We actually took capital from Health Velocity Capital at a lower valuation than what other investors had offered… and it was worth it. Almost immediately after investing, the Health Velocity Capital team facilitated commercial relationships with one of largest payers and one of largest health systems in the US. Also, the operating experience they bring is especially helpful when working to address issues that undoubtedly come about throughout the course of growing the business'

    company: 'OnShift',
    quote: 'There’s nothing the Health Velocity Capital team wouldn’t do for their companies. They introduced us to our VP Sales before they even invested, introduced us to an industry leading board member and several clients, and when the Cavaliers beat the Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals, Marty lost a bet to me and had to put a poster of ME in his (and his wife’s) bedroom for a full year! They are patient, supportive, long-term partners, but they are also great friends.'
